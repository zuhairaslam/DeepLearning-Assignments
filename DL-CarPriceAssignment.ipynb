Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"image/png":"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
